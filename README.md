# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city entered by the user.


## Features

- Search weather details by city name  
- Displays real-time temperature, humidity, and wind speed  
- Dynamic weather icons based on live conditions  
- Error message for invalid city names  
- Simple and responsive layout


## How It Works

1. The user enters a city name in the search box.  
2. The application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.  
3. Weather details such as city name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed are extracted from the API response.  
4. The information is displayed dynamically on the page.  
5. The icon updates automatically according to the weather condition (e.g., clouds, rain, clear sky).
